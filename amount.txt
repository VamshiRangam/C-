the fields for amounts are edited numeric and signed

 -> They are right justified, space or 0 filled and include a decimal point
 -> the example formats shows 2 decimal positions, which applies to most
   currencies,place the decimal point in the appropriate place for the
   currency involved. Currencies with no decimal positions should not include
   a decimal point
   
 -> the sign is a leading hyphen for a negative amount
 -> the sign is a leading space for a positive amount

 positive amounts will contain a leading space(if space filled) or zero (if zero-filled)
 in the first position.for negative amounts the leading space or zero will be replaced with a hyphen

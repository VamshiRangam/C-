Hi Anbu,

I am writing to request an early release from my notice period, with my last working day being [September 23rd 2024]. I have received an onsite opportunity that requires me to start as soon as possible.

I understand the importance of fulfilling my notice period, and I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition. I am prepared to expedite the handover process and assist in any way necessary to minimize any disruption.

I would greatly appreciate your understanding and support in this matter. Please let me know if we can discuss this further or if there are any specific tasks you would like me to prioritize.

Thank you for your consideration.
